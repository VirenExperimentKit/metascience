2016,The Evolving Meaning of Information Security.,"When you are developing security systems, new penetration techniques seem to appear as responses to new security measures but in general the flow is the other way around: security exists and evolves because of the evolution of threats. Beginning with the rise of radio in the 20th Century attacks on communication networks have shown two forms: those that go for the big kill --- such as the breaking of Enigma --- and those that assemble small seemingly innocuous leaks of information into a comprehensive understanding of the target's behavior. We will analyze the way in which these trends interact with others to create a situation in which what is possible in security and even the meaning of security in communication networks needs reexamination."

2015,Keys under doormats: mandating insecurity by requiring government access to all data and communications.,"Twenty years ago, law enforcement organizations lobbied to require data and communication services to engineer their products to guarantee law enforcement access to all data. After lengthy debate and vigorous predictions of enforcement channels “going dark,” these attempts to regulate security technologies on the emerging Internet were abandoned. In the intervening years, innovation on the Internet flourished, and law enforcement agencies found new and more effective means of accessing vastly larger quantities of data. Today, there are again calls for regulation to mandate the provision of exceptional access mechanisms. In this article, a group of computer scientists and security experts, many of whom participated in a 1997 study of these same topics, has convened to explore the likely effects of imposing extraordinary access mandates.

We have found that the damage that could be caused by law enforcement exceptional access requirements would be even greater today than it would have been 20 years ago. In the wake of the growing economic and social cost of the fundamental insecurity of today’s Internet environment, any proposals that alter the security dynamics online should be approached with caution. Exceptional access would force Internet system developers to reverse “forward secrecy” design practices that seek to minimize the impact on user privacy when systems are breached. The complexity of today’s Internet environment, with millions of apps and globally connected services, means that new law enforcement requirements are likely to introduce unanticipated, hard to detect security flaws. Beyond these and other technical vulnerabilities, the prospect of globally deployed exceptional access systems raises difficult problems about how such an environment would be governed and how to ensure that such systems would respect human rights and the rule of law."

2007,"Cryptography: Past, Present and Future.","Abstract
For most of the era of electronic communication, encryption the technique of protecting communications by scrambling them was largely a government preserve. Before modern electronics, encryption was too expensive for widespread business use. Most development was secret, carried out by the government, and reserved for government use. Cryptography was treated as a weapon under the export-control laws. Encryption systems could not be exported for commercial purposes, even to close allies and trading partners.
During the 1980s and 1990s, cryptography emerged from its former obscurity and became an important aspect of commercial communications. The rise of the personal computer and the Internet changed encryption from an exotic military-only technology to one critical for Internet commerce. Despite this, governments, especially that of the U..S., were slow to accept the new reality. Industry efforts to develop and use cryptography were thwarted by export-control regulations, which emerged as the dominant government influence on the development and deployment of encryption technology. By the late 1990s, the U.S. government, which had made repeated attempts to continue its domination of the field, held a stance that was barely tenable in the rest of the world. Influences varying from the rise of open-source software to European indignation at evidence the U.S. was spying on their communications came together to force a change.
The new regulations distinguish government customers from commercial onesand retail from customized technology. As a result, cryptography can nowbe exported with minimal government interference for most commercial and many government applications, to all countries except those regarded as supporters of terrorism."

1994,Privacy and authentication for wireless local area networks.,"Abstract:
Wireless networks are being driven by the need for providing network access to mobile or nomadic computing devices. Although the need for wireless access to a network is evident, new problems are inherent in the wireless medium itself. Specifically, the wireless medium introduces new opportunities for eavesdropping on wireless data communications. Anyone with an appropriate wireless receiver can eavesdrop, and this kind of eavesdropping is virtually undetectable. Furthermore, since the wireless medium cannot be contained by the usual physical constraints of walls and doors, active intrusions through the wireless medium are also made easier. In order to prevent this unauthorized access to the network, the authors present the design of a secure communication protocol that provides for both the privacy of wireless data communications and the authenticity of communicating parties. The placement of the protocol in the overall protocol stack and issues relevant to wireless links and mobile computing devices are discussed. They also present proof of the security of the protocol using the logic of authentication formalism developed by Burrows, Abadi, and Needham (1990).< >"
1992,Authentication and Authenticated Key Exchanges.,"We discuss two-party mutual authentication protocols providing authenticated key exchange, focusing on those using asymmetric techniques. A simple, efficient protocol referred to as the station-to-station (STS) protocol is introduced, examined in detail, and considered in relation to existing protocols. The definition of a secure protocol is considered, and desirable characteristics of secure protocols are discussed.

1989,The Adolescence of Public-Key Cryptography (Abstract).,"Abstract
Public-key cryptosystems separate the capacities for encryption and decryption so that 1) many people can encrypt messages in such a way that only one person can read them, or 2) one person can encrypt messages in such a way that many people can read them. This separation allows important improvements in the management of cryptographic keys and makes it possible to â€˜signâ€™ a purely digital message."
1988,A Secure Audio Teleconference System.,"Abstract
Users of large communication networks often require a multi-party teleconferencing facility. The most common technique for providing secure audio teleconferencing requires the speech of each participant to be returned to clear form in a bridge circuit where it is combined with the speech of the other participants. The combined signal is then re-encrypted for distribution to the conferees. This introduces a security weakness as the bridge works with the clear speech and the cipher keys for all of the participants. In this paper we describe secure conferencing systems in which some of the bridge functions are distributed among the users so that no additional security weakness is introduced. The network conference bridge knows the addresses of the participants and receives and distributes the encrypted speech without modification. The conference system can be used with a number of encryption algorithms and the system is suitable for deployment on digital networks such as ISDN. High quality and robust secure voice communications can be provided with this technique."
1985,Security for the DoD Transmission Control Protocol.,"Abstract
In securing packet switched digital communications, it is possible to add the security measures at almost any layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model of network functioning. At one extreme, security may be supplied either by physical protection of the communication links (with no impact at all on network communication protocols) or by independent encryption of the traffic on each link of the network (with little protocol impact). Solutions or this sort are called link security and, although widely employed, have the disadvantage of requiring the users to place a high degree of trust in the network. At the other extreme, it is possible, using cryptography, to add security to each individual user level application. This has the advantage of minimizing the userâ€™s need to trust the network and thus providing end-to-end security, but also has the disadvantage of requiring a multiplicity of implementations."
1985,Analysis of a Public Key Approach Based on Polynomial Substitution.,"6 Conclusions
We set out to build a public key cryptosystem by repeatedly substituting for variables in multivariate polynomials and simplifying the results to conceal the substitution process. There seems, however, to be no way to build such a system that is both secure and has a public key of practical size when the devices used to limit the number of coefficeints are nilpotence and J-rings. We have only shown, however, that it is impossible to produce such a system if the total degree of the encryption polynomial determines the size of the public key. Perhaps, by properly choosing p 0 and p 1, we can employ the fundamental scheme to produce sparse encrypting polynomials. Then the public key could be kept small while the encrypting polynomial bas large total degree and is difficult to invert."
1983,Securing Networks: End-to-End Encryption vs. Link Encryption and Trusted Systems.,"Today, two components are prominent in the technology of communication network security: cryptography and trusted systems. Reflection on the roles of these two components shows that both are essential, that some element of each must occur in any secure network. At the same time, there is an element of competition and some network designs treat encryption as primary, supported by only the minimum of trusted software, while others take the opposite course. At one extreme, a network can employ end-to-end encryption as its primary security mechanism. In such a network, two users in secure contact rely on their exclusive possession of a common key to guarantee that their messages cannot be understood or imitated by others, regardless of whether intervening components of the network perform correctly or not. Here, trusted systems are limited to the role in which they cannot be avoided: decisions on how keys are to be distributed. At the other extreme, a network can employ cryptography only to create the appearance of overall physical security. Link encryption is used to protect the exposed communication paths and for no other purpose. The problem is reduced to that of designing a multi-level secure operating system; the fact that it may span continents is concealed. In arguing for the cryptographic approach, one could point out that trusted system technology is new and its products are prone to the performance and cost problems common with new technologies. They would say that cryptography, by comparison, is a well developed art. The trusted system people, on the other hand, would assert that cryptography is inflexible and cannot adequately support the complex security policies required. Despite the value of many of these implementation arguments, the actual distinction lies more in the network builders notions of trust and authority. The user of a system that relies primarily on trusted system technology may be extremely well protected from opponents outside the network, but can have no true security from the network builders and administrators. This sense of security is perhaps best suited to users who are employees and act within a hierarchical authority structure. The user of an end-to-end encrypted network on the other hand can be very certain that his traffic is protected from everyone except the person he is conversing with. This situation is more closely aligned with our notions of a user who is part of a voluntary association. "

1976,New directions in cryptography.,"Abstract:
Two kinds of contemporary developments in cryptography are examined. Widening applications of teleprocessing have given rise to a need for new types of cryptographic systems, which minimize the need for secure key distribution channels and supply the equivalent of a written signature. This paper suggests ways to solve these currently open problems. It also discusses how the theories of communication and computation are beginning to provide the tools to solve cryptographic problems of long standing."
1976,Multiuser cryptographic techniques.,"This paper deals with new problems which arise in the application of cryptography to computer communication systems with large numbers of users. Foremost among these is the key distribution problem. We suggest two techniques for dealing with this problem. The first employs current technology and requires subversion of several separate key distribution nodes to compromise the system's security. Its disadvantage is a high overhead for single message connections. The second technique is still in the conceptual phase, but promises to eliminate completely the need for a secure key distribution channel, by making the sender's keying information public. It is also shown how such a public key cryptosystem would allow the development of an authentication system which generates an unforgeable, message dependent digital signature.
