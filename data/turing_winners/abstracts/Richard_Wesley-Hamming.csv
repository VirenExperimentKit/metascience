1994,Science Is in the Eye of the Beholder.,"Abstract
The way you view science limits the things that you can do scientificallyù. Fortunately scienceù is not a single thing but an evolving concept of how to cope with the world, and this flexible attitude towards science can be useful. The rigid view gives strict guidance on how to proceed ‚Äúscientifically‚Äù, while the more flexible approach allows for a greater range of response on your part. This paper gives some of the various views of what science is, in the hope that it will liberate you from being too strict without at the same time losing the useful guidance that ‚Äúscience‚Äù often provides."

1969,One Man's View of Computer Science.,"A number of observations and comments are directed toward suggesting that more than the usual engineering flavor be given to computer science. The engineering aspect is important because most present difficulties in this field do not involve the theoretical question of whether certain things can be done, but rather the practical question of how can they be accomplished well and simply. The teaching of computer science could be made more effective by various alterations, for example, the inclusion of a laboratory course in programming, the requirement for a strong minor in something other than mathematics, and more practical coding and less abstract theory, as well as more seriousness and less game playing."
1966,A Class of Integration Formulas.,"Gregory's formula for numerically integrating a function is one of the most promising formulas for use in a computer library. This paper shows how Gregory's formula can be generalized, and examines special cases which have a number of very favorable properties for library use."

1965,A Note on the Location of the Binary Point in a Computing Machine.,"Abstract:
Necessary conditions that a switching function be, in particular, a threshold function have been introduced by Paull and McCluskey [11]; named and studied at some length by Winder [13], [14], [15] and Muroga, et al. [8]; and generalized by Elgot [3], Winder [14], [15] and Gabelman [4]. The basic conditions are the k-monotonicities and have been used not only to recognize threshold functions but also to determine realizing weights and threshold."
