2018,Blocks as digital entities: A standards perspective.,"The notion of thoughts, ideas and other information fixed in a tangible medium of expression for purposes of reproducing, displaying or communicating the information to others has its origins in antiquity. Both the information itself and its symbolic expression are purely conceptual entities until fixed in a material object. When an intangible means of expression, in which symbolic logic is represented as or converted to machine-independent data structures in digital form, and structured as digital objects (i.e., digital entities), this implementation may be viewed as the logical equivalent of fixation in a material object; and, in this context, we are viewing a block as a particular way of structuring a digital object, and a blockchain in itself as a digital object that incorporates one or more objects.
In considering the development of commerce based on the Digital Object (DO) Architecture, an interesting area for exploration and development has been introduced around the concept of mobile computer programs configured as digital objects. This technology may play an important role in the management of software embedded in new Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as microcontrollers, where issues have arisen with respect to the interoperability of such software with other resources in the developing IoT. There have been many efforts over the years to evolve the Internet to embrace new technology, such as the DO Architecture, and we hope this trend continues unabated.

2012,"Information, Data, Security in a Networked Future.","The digital information revolution begins as giants such as Alan Turing, Claude Shannon and John von neumann, among many others, recognize the power of digital representations and programmable computers. Although rooted in the technology of his time, Vannevar Bush's portrait of the information revolution has emerged and fl ourished especially in the form of the World Wide Web resting atop the global Internet.
The panelists will explore some specifi cs of the digital information revolution, notably theory and practice in securing, authenticating and maintaining the integrity of information (Cerf); and roots of modern cryptography and current topics in this area (rivest and Shamir). They will also gain insight into the long-term problem of identifying, fi nding, and assuring the integrity of digital objects in the most general sense of that term (Kahn). Finally, they look at how our understanding of computer science is changing (Hopcroft) and how that evolution will affect the digital world in which are we spending an increasing fraction of our daily lives."
2010,The long quest for universal information access.,Digital object repositories are on the cusp of resolving the long-standing problem of universal information access in the Internet.
2009,A brief history of the internet.,"This paper was first published online by the Internet Society in December 20031 and is being re-published in ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review because of its historic import. It was written at the urging of its primary editor, the late Barry Leiner. He felt that a factual rendering of the events and activities associated with the development of the early Internet would be a valuable contribution. The contributing authors did their best to incorporate only factual material into this document. There are sure to be many details that have not been captured in the body of the document but it remains one of the most accurate renderings of the early period of development available."
2006,A framework for distributed digital object services.,"The following paper was written by the authors over a period of approximately 16 months during the period November 1993 to May 1995 in an attempt to explore a set of open research issues and to integrate them with certain ideas of a small group of researchers who had been briefed on the notions inherent in the Digital Object Architecture that one of the authors (Kahn) had been developing at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI). This research group had been organized by CNRI as part of its ""Computer Science Technical Reports"" (CSTR) project that was funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The CSTR project had several objectives, of which one was to digitize existing collections of technical reports from five leading computer science departments at universities in the U.S and make the reports available on the Internet. A second objective was to fund research at these institutions on digital libraries, especially research that made good use of their local collections. A third objective was to link heterogeneous electronic libraries, such as were being developed in the program. The difficulties inherent in this third objective ultimately led to this paper. In particular, the motivation arose from a set of concerns first expressed by these researchers at a meeting at CNRI on October 25, 1993 when the Digital Object Architecture was first presented to the research group by Kahn. In the discussion that resulted, many issues emerged, some of which we ultimately decided must be resolved in any architecture, and some of which-perhaps just as crucially-could be deferred for the time being. For example, questions arose about the role of semantics in identifiers; we decided to address them early on. Another issue that proved controversial was how to deal with situations in which the digital objects were actually mobile programs in the network. Since a digital object could contain other digital objects, this led directly to the notion of a mobile repository. The basic question was how best to describe this kind of situation and explain how to access information that was not at a known specific location or IP address on the net. We decided not to cover this aspect of the architecture in the interest of getting closure on the paper. A critical part of this effort was dealing with various intellectual property issues; and the architecture was designed to take this important aspect into account. We were fortunate to have the help of Ms. Patrice Lyons, an experienced intellectual property lawyer, in the formulation of certain key elements of the architecture dealing with terms and conditions for access to information, and in the drafting of the paper. Although her name does not appear on the paper, her insights and contributions played an important role in the preparation of the paper. One key component of the architecture is a general-purpose resolution system, known as the Handle System®, an implementation of which has been operational on the Internet since 1994. At present, close to 50 million identifiers are assigned to digital objects and resolvable by the system, which has been available 7x24 for many years. It is anticipated that the number of resolvable identifiers in the system will grow rapidly and could easily exceed a billion in the not too distant future."
2006,Representing Value as Digital Objects: A Discussion of Transferability and Anonymity.,"This article discusses the use of ""digital objects"" to represent ""value"" in the network environment. Deeds of trust, mortgages, bills of lading and digital cash can all be represented as digital objects. The notion of ""transferable records"" structured as digital objects is introduced, along with references to its application in real financial situations. Even in a formal information system, anonymity reflects the desire of a holder of value to remain incognito, except as he or she wishes to be made known. The use of unique, persistent identifiers and a resolution mechanism to fashion such a capability for anonymity and transferability is shown."
2005,A protocol for packet network intercommunication.,"A protocol that supports the sharing of resources that exist in different packet switching networks is presented. The protocol provides for variation in individual network packet sizes, transmission failures, sequencing, flow control, end-to-end error checking, and the creation and destruction of logical process-to-process connections. Some implementation issues are considered, and problems such as internetwork routing, accounting, and timeouts are exposed."

1985,Information processing technology for emergency management.,"Several information processing technologies which are capable of augmenting human performance in handling a range of emergency situations are featured in this discussion. Among the more sophisticated systems which have proven useful in enhancing information collection, transmission, and selective processing are packet radio networks, “expert planning systems,” multiple?satellite technology, and such related emerging developments as “internetting” and “machine intelligence.”"
1975,The organization of computer resources into a packet radio network.,"In this paper, we describe the use of packet radio communication for organizing computer resources into a computer communications network. A system to demonstrate the packet radio concept is being developed by the Advanced Research Projects Agency with initial testing in the San Francisco area beginning in 1975. The attributes of this system are presented and its application to mobile radio communications and computer architecture is briefly discussed."
1972,Computer communication network design: Experience with theory and practice.,"The design of the ARPA Computer Network brought together many individuals with diverse backgrounds and philosophies. In this paper, we review the methods used in the design of the Network from the vantage of over two years' experience in its development. The design variables, system constraints, and performance criteria for the network are discussed along with an evaluation of the tools used to design an efficient and reliable system. The design procedures and the conclusions reached about the network's properties appear to be generally applicable to message switched networks. Consequently, the results of this paper should be useful in the design and study of other store?and?forward computer communication networks.

1972,Computer communication network design: experience with theory and practice.,"The ARPA Network (ARPANET) project brought together many individuals with diverse backgrounds, philosophies, and technical approaches from the fields of computer science, communication theory, operations research and others. The project was aimed at providing an efficient and reliable computer communications system (using message switching techniques) in which computer resources such as programs, data, storage, special purpose hardware etc., could be shared among computers and among many users. The variety of design methods, ranging from theoretical modeling to hardware development, were primarily employed independently, although cooperative efforts among designers occurred on occasion. As of November, 1971, the network has been an operational facility for many months, with about 20 participating sites, a network information center accessible via the net, and well over a hundred researchers, system programmers, computer center directors and other technical and administrative personnel involved in its operation."
1970,The interface message processor for the ARPA computer network.,"For many years, small groups of computers have been interconnected in various ways. Only recently, however, has the interaction of computers and communications become an important topic in its own right. In 1968, after considerable preliminary investigation and discussion, the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the Department of Defense (ARPA) embarked on the implementation of a new kind of nationwide computer interconnection known as the ARPA Network. This network will initially interconnect many dissimilar computers at ten ARPA-supported research centers with 50-kilobit common-carrier circuits. The network may be extended to include many other locations and circuits of higher bandwidth."
1965,Sampling representations and the optimum reconstruction of signals.,"Abstract:
This paper treats the problem of the representation and reconstruction of signals from several sets of sampled values using a multiple-channel sampling and reconstruction scheme. Realizable and unrealizable solutions are presented for the optimum linear postfiltering and prefiltering operations. It is shown that the number of ""independent"" sets of samples which are necessary for the exact reconstruction of a signal is equal to the maximum number of overlappings of its sampled spectrum. This enables many different sampling expansions to be derived. The simultaneous optimization of the unrealizable linear prefilter and postfilter combination is carried out for the case where two sets of sampled values are taken. It is shown that with the optimum combination of filters, the angular frequency range of the input signal is limited by the prefilters to a total width of 4\pi \rho , which is a natural extension of the single-channel result."
1965,Some bandwidth properties of simultaneous amplitude and angle modulation.,"Abstract:
This paper treats some bandwidth properties of modulated signals of the form q(t) \cos [\omega_{c}t + \varphi(t)] where both q(t) and \varphi(t) are modulating time functions. For such simultaneous amplitude and angle modulation (AAM), relationships are given connecting the bandwidth of the modulated signal with the properties of the modulating time functions. Some useful bounds on the bandwidth are found and a relationship is derived between the amplitude and the angle modulating functions which results in a minimum bandwidth. Several examples of such minimum bandwidth signals are given."
