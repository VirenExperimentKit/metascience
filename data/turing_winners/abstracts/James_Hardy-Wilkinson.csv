1992,Numerical Considerations in Computing Invariant Subspaces.,"This paper describes two methods for computing the invariant subspace of a matrix. The first method involves using transformations to interchange the eigenvalues. The matrix is assumed to be in Schur form and transformations are applied to interchange neighbouring blocks. The blocks can be either one by one or two by two. The second method involves the construction of an invariant subspace by a direct computation of the vectors, rather than by applying transformations to move the desired eigenvalues to the top of the matrix."
1975,On the Stability of Gauss-Jordan Elimination with Pivoting.,"The stability of the Gauss-Jordan algorithm with partial pivoting for the solution of general systems of linear equations is commonly regarded as suspect. It is shown that in many respects suspicions are unfounded, and in general the absolute error in the solution is strictly comparable with that corresponding to Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting plus back substitution. However, when A is ill conditioned, the residual corresponding to the Gauss-Jordan solution will often be much greater than that corresponding to the Gaussian elimination solution."
1970,The Least Squares Problem and Pseudo-Inverses.,"This paper presents a number of the most efficient mothods for computing the pseudo-inverse of an m × n matrix, developing them from a uniform standpoint. It shows that these are the natural extentions of the more common methods for inverting an n × n matrix.

1969,Eigenvalues of Ax = ?Bx with band symmetric A and B.,"Describes an efficient algorithm for the calculation of specified eigenvalues of Ax = ?Bx with band symmetric A and B, the latter being positive definite. Each eigenvalue is isolated using the Sturm sequence property of leading principal minors of A ? ?B and is then computed accurately using a modified version of successive linear interpolation.

1965,"Convergence of the LR, QR, and Related Algorithms.","Existing proofs of the convergence of the LR and QR algorithms are based on rather sophisticated determinantal theory and are to some extent incomplete. This paper gives elementary but completely general proofs of convergence of the LR, QR and two related algorithms. The proofs are intended to deal with the case when the matrix has non-linear elementary divisors.

1965,The QR Algorithm for Real Symmetric Matrices with Multiple Eigenvalues.,"The success of the QR algorithm depends critically on the choice of the shifts of origin. This paper describes a method of choosing this shift which ultimately gives cubic convergence to the root of smallest modulus whatever its multiplicity.
"
1965,The calculation of Lamé polynomials.,"The coefficients of Lamé polynomials may be determined from the eigenvectors of certain tridiagonal matrices. Although these matrices have extraordinarily ill-conditioned eigensystems it is shown that there is a simple procedure by means of which the eigenvectors may be determined accurately without resorting to high-precision arithmetic.

1962,Instability of the Elimination Method of Reducing a Matrix to Tri-diagonal Form.,"An error analysis is given of the instability which arises in the reduction of a matrix of Hessenberg form to tri-diagonal form. An economical way of minimizing the loss of accuracy resulting from such an instability is described, and a method is sketched which makes it possible in certain situations to eliminate the instability.

1961,An Efficient Scheme for the Co-diagonalization of a Symmetric Matrix by Givens' Method in a Computer with a Two-level Store.,"The Givens' process, as it is commonly performed, requires simultaneous rapid access both to rows and to columns of the matrix. By running in parallel the various rotations which produce a row of zeros it is possible to reduce the number of scans of the matrix by a factor of order n. The scanning required is then less than that for Householder's process, which is, however, faster in other ways. The number of multiplications and the rounding errors for the modified Givens' process are the same as when the rotations are carried out sequentially, but on Mercury there is an overall gain in speed by a factor of 7 for matrices of order 96.

1961,Rigorous Error Bounds for Computer Eigensystems.,"This paper describes techniques for the automatic determination of rigorous error bounds for a computer eigensystem. The methods used, lead directly to an improved eigensystem and the error bounds are for the improved system. They have the same theoretical basis as the method of H. Jahn, but here the main emphasis is on the organization of the computation which is necessary for the determination of the error bounds.

It is claimed that the technique described is the most satisfactory of known methods for general symmetric matrices and may have considerable advantages for unsymmetric matrices. The details of the computation for a simple numerical example are given, and also the results obtained for a 14 × 14 matrix using the ACE computer."

Both the symmetric and the unsymmetric forms are treated. It shows that with suitable modifications, the method described by the author for finding the eigenvectors by means of the Givens transformation, can be made to give accurate results for both of the Lanczos transformations.
