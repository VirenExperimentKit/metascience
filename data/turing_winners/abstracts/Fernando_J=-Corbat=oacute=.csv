2012,"Systems Architecture, Design, Engineering, and Verification - The Practice in Research and Research in Practice.","More than any other area in computer science, the interaction and boundary between science and engineering is blurred in the systems area, with cross fertilization from both directions. The systems panel will explore the past, present and future relationship between systems research and engineering practice.
They will discuss the relationship between systems research and engineering practices: when does systems innovation emanating from industry become an invention and when does academic research stop being science and become engineering? How does practice-driven research impact the real world and how does the real world reflect back on foundations? In what forms does technology create research challenges, and in what manner does applied research give solid base for development?
They will surmise about the future of systems research: What are the fundamental challenges posed by the scale of today's cloud computing systems and mega-size data centers? How to organize software of large-scale distributed executions or mega-ton lines of code? What new opportunities are enabled by novel technologies like flash memory and transactional memory? How to integrate hand-in-hand design of software and architecture?"

1992,CTSS-the compatible time-sharing system.,"Abstract:
Excerpts are presented from a 1962 paper by Fernando Corbato, M. Merwin-Daggett, and R.C. Daley. The selection from the paper, which reported work completed in late 1961, is reprinted from Proc. Spring Joint Computer Conf., vol.21, 1962. In this system, the time-sharing occurs among four users, three of whom are online each at a typewriter in a foreground system, and a fourth passive user of the background FAP-MAD-MADTRAN-BSS Monitor System used by most of the MIT Computation Center programmers and by many other 7090 installations."
1992,Project MAC (time-sharing computing project).,"Abstract:
The history of Project MAC from its inception is reviewed. It is noted that the story of Project MAC is a continuation of that of CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System), marking the transfer of an experimental system into the practical academic field and thence into the commercial field. Two men were key to this recognition of the value of the work by Corbato et al.-J.C.R. Licklider and R.M. Fano. Licklider's early concepts of man-computer symbiosis were identified as being supportive of the ideas which led to the development of CTSS, and his relocation to the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) puts him in a position to do something about his aspirations. Excerpts from reports dealing with Project MAC are presented."

1972,Multics: the first seven years.,"In 1964, following implementation of the Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS) serious planning began on the development of a new computer system specifically organized as a prototype of a computer utility. The plans and aspirations for this system, called Multics (for Multiplexed Information and Computing Service), were described in a set of six papers presented at the 1965 Fall Joint Computer Conference. The development of the system was undertaken as a cooperative effort involving the Bell Telephone Laboratories (from 1965 to 1969), the computer department of the General Electric Company, and Project MAC of M.I.T."
1968,Some considerations of supervisor program design for multiplexed computer systems.,"One of the principal hurdles in developing multiplexed computer systems is acquiring sufficient insight into the apparently complex problems encountered. The paper isolates two system objectives by distinguishing between problems related to multiplexing and those arising from sharing of information. In both cases, latent problems of noninteractive systems are shown to be aggravated by interacting people. Viewpoints such as reversibility of binding, and mechanisms such as segmentation, are suggested as approaches to acquiring insight. It is argued that only such analysis and functional understanding can lead to simplifications needed to allow design of more sophisticated systems."

1959,Generation of Spherical Bessel Functions in Digital Computers.,A method of computation for spherical Bessel functions of real and imaginary argument is given which is especially suitable for high speed digital computers. The accuracy and convergence are examined and criterion formulas are given. A procedure based on the Wronskian is used to simplify the final normalization.
