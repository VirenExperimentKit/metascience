2009,The Origin of the Integrated Data Store (IDS): The First Direct-Access DBMS.,"Abstract:
The integrated data store (IDS), the first direct-access database management system, was developed at General Electric in the early 1960s. Revisiting the development challenges that lead to its first production version reveals the origins of DBMSs and their impact on software development and business management. IDS and its derivative systems are still in use today, supporting a thousand mainframe installations."

1989,"A Personal Chronicle: Creating Better Information Systems, with Some Guiding Principles.","Abstract:
The author identifies four guiding principles which have come into play in this work of creating information systems and tools to support information systems. The first principle, open-eyes, is used to characterize information systems that remain open to new information, and consequently can compensate for changes in their mission or inaccuracies in their execution of that mission. The second principle involves abstraction levels, which in information systems are similar to differentiation in calculus. They are used to study the changes within a group of heterogeneous objects, with respect to an object type classification, so as to understand and make use of their patterns and ultimately to control the new objects of each type. The third principle, layered architecture, is used to identify a pattern of successive reimplementations of a set of functions, so as to isolate specific environmentally oriented issues. The fourth principle involves relationships, used to define associations between objects and constraints on those associations and to provide access to objects based on their associations. Reference is made to several specific projects which revealed the operation of these principles.< >"

1982,Toward a More Complete Reference Model of Computer-Based Information Systems.,Standardization in Information Systems profits from the existence of an overall model or design which enables the standard-designers to see the context in which the individual efforts are progressing. Such a model is proposed by the authors who suggest that ISO1 organize its work in conformance to this framework.
1981,The Context of Open Systems Interconnection Within Computer-Based Information Systems.,"Abstract
The current development within ISO on the Reference Model of Open Systems Interconnectionù and the supportive Service and Protocol Specifications represent a major contribution, which this paper attempts to place into the larger context of computer-based information systems and to show its relationship to complementary functional sub-architectures."

1977,Why restrict the modelling capability of CODASYL data structure sets?,"Several issues have been raised concerning changes to the capabilities of the CODASYL Data Description Language specifications for data structure sets. The paper argues against new restrictions suggested and for removal of existing restrictions. The issues are:
allow recursive set declaration
keep multiple member declaration
allow alternate owner declarations
The concept of ""record-roles"" is introduced to justify the need for these capabilities. The expanded capabilities described offer an alternate means of achieving the same end result without the need to introduce the ""record-role"" into the CODASYL Data Description Language."
1977,The Role Concept in Data Models.,"A new data model is described which permits the representation of the different roles which a real world entity may play. This data model is an extension of the network model, as used in I-D-S and its derivative, the CODASYL database system. The concepts of item and set are retained. The record concept has been refined to clarify the old record concept and introduce the new role-segment concept. The record represents the existence of an entity of the real world while the role-segment represents the existence of one of the entity's roles.

A person and a corporation are examples of an entity, while a stockholder and a customer are examples of a role that either the person or corporation can assume. A role-segment occurrence serves to group and name the properties concerning the existence of one role.

This paper shows that the record and role segment concepts can be integrated into the required data description and data manipulation language.

The meta entity types of the role data model are contrasted with those of older data models for the data occurrence domain. The ambigous use of meta types by the older models is thus shown. This ambiguity appears to prohibit those older data models from serving as the basis of a conceptual schema where data transformation support of richer data models is required.

The meta entity types of the role data model are identified, described and related to the real world, data occurrence, conceptual schema, and data description domains."
1975,Trends in database management: 1975.,"The subject of database management systems is receiving attention at an accelerating rate. The work of the COBOL Data Base Task Group (DBTG) has achieved major acceptance. This acceptance can be measured in terms of the number of computer systems for which DBTG software is now available, and the number of customers who have successfully installed application systems based upon this software. While the specifications are yet imperfect and development committees will be refining them for years, it appears to this author that a major step in the evolution of computerized information systems has been accomplished. Integrated database systems are here to stay."

1974,The CODASYL and GUIDE/SHARE proposals on data base management systems.,"Six panelists will discuss the subject of Data Base Management (DBM) as it relates to CODASYL's Data Base Language Task Group report and Data Definition Language Committee Report and the GUIDE/SHARE published requirements for a DBM and other published GUIDE documents deemed pertinent. Four key issues that best deal with the philosophy, concepts and differences of the CODASYL and GUIDE/SHARE work to date will be addressed."
1974,The Data-Structure-Set Model.,"I think we have a discussion today; not a debate. Its real purpose is to increase our understanding of the basic concepts underlying data base structures and their models; to note the similarities and differences between them, and to determine their compatibility or the lack thereof. We are talking about concepts, not about implementations. The reason for all data base structuring is retrieval: retrieval for output, retrieval for decision-making, retrieval for updating. To pinpoint the object of retrieval we must intelligently select the ‚Äúright‚Äù data‚Äîthe correct single record, the correct group of records, and, in some sense, the correct sequence of records (in those situations where the sequence in which these records are seen is important). For accurate selection, dependent on the particular interests, needs, and requirements of a given person, we want a mechanism for readily defining records to be selected. We want a mechanism that will permit the data base to evolve as the enterprise and information systems change. We want a mechanism which will protect already existing investment in programs and report specifications, while the data base evolves. We want a mechanism which permits the reoptimization of the structure of stored data as things change."
1973,The Programmer as Navigator.,"This year the whole world celebrates the five-hundredth birthday of Nicolaus Copernicus, the famous Polish astronomer and mathematician. In 1543, Copernicus published his book, Concerning the Revolutions of Celestial Spheres, which described a new theory about the relative physical movements of the earth, the planets, and the sun. It was in direct contradiction with the earth-centered theories which had been established by Ptolemy 1400 years earlier."
1972,The Evolution of Storage Structures.,"Data base management systems have grown rapidly in their power and complexity over the 15-year history of data processing on commercially available computers. The original concepts have split, and new terms have been adopted to name and refer to these concepts. The Data Structure Diagram graphic technique is used to illustrate the splitting of the concepts and the structural relations which exist between these concepts at each point in the evolution."
1972,"Architecture Definition Technique: Its Objectives Theory, Process, Facilities and Practice.","The Architectural Definition Technique (ADT) is an approach to arriving at a complete, concise, non-ambiguous functional specification of a software or hardware system which is totally independent of packaging considerations. The Architecture Definition Process (ADP) contains six manageable steps leading to the creation and communication of the desired functional specification. Fundamental to the process and its theory, is (1) the reduction of the user visible entities into the system's state variables as represented by machine processable entity classes, attribute classes and set classes and (2) the establishment of the user interface as machine processable function definition algorithms. The Architecture Definition Facility (ADF) which supports the Architecture Definition Process is described. A case study defining the functionality of a File System is used for tutorial purposes"

1966,On a generalized language for file organization and manipulation.,"I would like to speak on what I call a unified or generalized language for file organization and manipulation. I call it unified because some ideas from which disk file languages were developed are perfectly applicable to magnetic tape files, and would be a great improvement on the way we address files on magnetic tape today."
