2004,The Birth of Object Orientation: the Simula Languages.,"Abstract
The development of the programming languages Simula I and Simula 67 is briefly described. An attempt is made also to explain the cultural impact of the languages, in particular the object oriented aspects."
1998,Subtyping and Constructive Specification.,"The use of subtyping is explored in the context of a style of constructive specification. The intention is to enhance expressiveness and strengthen syntactic controls. The resulting specification style is part of a wide spectrum language, ABEL, developed at the Oslo University. A concept of signature completeness is presented, as well as a completion algorithm. Some results relating to weak, strong, and optimal typing are proved. "
1998,On Introducing Higher Order Functions in ABEL.,"We discuss how the 1'st order specification and programming language ABEL could be extended with higher order functions. Several issues arise, related to subtyping, parameterization, strictness of generators and defined functions, and to the choice between lambda expressions and currying. The paper can be regarded as an exercise in language design: how to introduce higher order functions under the restrictions enforced by (1'st order) ABEL. A technical result is a soundness proof for covariant subtype replacement, useful when implementing data types under volume constraints imposed by computer hardware."
1991,Generator Induction in Order Sorted Algebras.,"Linguistic and semantic consequences of combining the ideas of order sorted algebras (as in OBJ) and generator induction (as in Larch) are investigated. It is found that one can gain the advantages of both, in addition to increased flexibility in defining signatures and generator bases. Our treatment also gives rise to typing control stronger in a certain sense than that of OBJ, as well as the detection of inherently inconsistent signatures.

1974,An Approach to Correctness Proofs of Semicoroutines.,"Abstract
The paper discusses local correctness criteria and local correctness proofs of semicoroutines subject to certain simplifying assumptions. A nontrivial worked example is given."
1966,SIMULA - an ALGOL-based simulation language.,"This paper is an introduction to SIMULA, a programming language designed to provide a systems analyst with unified concepts which facilitate the concise description of discrete event systems. A system description also serves as a source language simulation program. SIMULA is an extension of ALGOL 60 in which the most important new concept is that of quasi-parallel processing."
