2012,"Systems Architecture, Design, Engineering, and Verification - The Practice in Research and Research in Practice.","More than any other area in computer science, the interaction and boundary between science and engineering is blurred in the systems area, with cross fertilization from both directions. The systems panel will explore the past, present and future relationship between systems research and engineering practice.
They will discuss the relationship between systems research and engineering practices: when does systems innovation emanating from industry become an invention and when does academic research stop being science and become engineering? How does practice-driven research impact the real world and how does the real world reflect back on foundations? In what forms does technology create research challenges, and in what manner does applied research give solid base for development?
They will surmise about the future of systems research: What are the fundamental challenges posed by the scale of today's cloud computing systems and mega-size data centers? How to organize software of large-scale distributed executions or mega-ton lines of code? What new opportunities are enabled by novel technologies like flash memory and transactional memory? How to integrate hand-in-hand design of software and architecture?"

1993,The Use of Name Spaces in Plan 9.,Plan 9 is a distributed system built at the Computing Sciences Research Center of AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories over the last few years. Its goal is to provide a production-quality system for software development and general computation using heterogeneous hardware and minimal software. A Plan 9 system comprises CPU and file servers in a central location connected together by fast networks. Slower networks fan out to workstation-class machines that serve as user terminals. Plan 9 argues that given a few carefully implemented abstractions it is possible to produce a small operating system that provides support for the largest systems on a variety of architectures and networks. The foundations of the system are built on two ideas: a per-process name space and a simple message-oriented file system protocol.
1993,Hello World.,"Plan 9 from Bell Labs has recently been converted from ASCII to an ASCII-compatible variant of Unicode, a 16-bit character set. In this paper we explain the reasons for the change, describe the character set and representation we chose, and present the programming models and software changes that support the new text format. Although we stopped short of full internationalization - for example, system error messages are in Unicode, not Japanese - we believe Plan 9 is the first system to treat the representation of all major languages on a uniform, equal footing throughout all its software."

1990,Reading Chess.,"Abstract:
By applying semantic analysis to images of extended passages of text, several volumes of a chess encyclopedia have been read with high accuracy. Although carefully proofread, the books were poorly printed and posed a severe challenge to conventional page-layout analysis and character-recognition methods. An experimental page-reader system performed strictly top-down layout analysis for identification of columns, lines, words, and characters. This proceeded rapidly and reliably thanks to a recently developed skew-estimation technique. Resegmentation of broken, touching, and dirty characters was handled in an efficient and integrated manner by a heuristic search operating on isolated words. By analyzing the syntax of game descriptions and applying the rules of chess, the error rate was reduced by a factor of 30 from what was achievable through shape analysis alone. Several computer vision systems integration issues suggested by this experience are discussed.< >"

1983,The UNIX Time-Sharing System (Reprint).,"UNIX is a general-purpose, multi-user, interactive operating system for the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-11/40 and 11/45 computers. It offers a number of features seldom found even in a larger operating systems, including: (1) a hierarchical file system incorporating demountable volumes; (2) compatible file, device, and inter-process I/O; (3) the ability to initiate asynchronous processes; (4) system command language selectable on a per-user basis; and (5) over 100 subsystems including a dozen languages. This paper discusses the nature and implementation of the file system and of the user command interface."

1981,Computer chess: Master level play in 1981?,"Two papers will be presented and a general discussion period will then follow. The panel members are all members of the ACM Computer Chess Committee. The first paper, which appears elsewhere in the Proceedings, is the work of Tony Marsland. It is entitled “A survey of enhancements to the alpha-beta algorithm.” The paper reviews move ordering and search reduction techniques which improve the effectiveness of the alpha-beta algorithm when used in a chess program. A critical review of these search modifications is provided, and a recursive formula to estimate the search time is proposed, one which reflects the characteristics of the strongly ordered trees produced through improved use of the alpha-beta algorithm."
1979,Password Security - A Case History.,This paper describes the history of the design of the password security scheme on a remotely accessed time-sharing system. The present design was the result of countering observed attempts to penetrate the system. The result is a compromise between extreme security and ease of use.

1968,Regular Expression Search Algorithm.,"A method for locating specific character strings embedded in character text is described and an implementation of this method in the form of a compiler is discussed. The compiler accepts a regular expression as source language and produces an IBM 7094 program as object language. The object program then accepts the text to be searched as input and produces a signal every time an embedded string in the text matches the given regular expression. Examples, problems, and solutions are also presented."
