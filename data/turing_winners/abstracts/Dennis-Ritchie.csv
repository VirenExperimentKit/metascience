1997,Inferno.,"Abstract:
Inferno/sup TM/ is an operating system for creating distributed services. It is a product of the Inferno Business Unit of Lucent Technologies and was developed by them and the Computing Science Research Center of Bell Labs, the R&D arm of Lucent Technologies. Although it is a new system designed specifically as a commercial product, it draws from many years of Bell Labs research in operating systems, languages, on-the-fly compilers, graphics, security, networking and portability."
1993,The Development of the C Language.,"The C programming language was devised in the early 1970s as a system implementation language for the nascent Unix operating system. Derived from the typeless language BCPL, it evolved a type structure; created on a tiny machine as a tool to improve a meager programming environment, it has become one of the dominant languages of today. This paper studies its evolution."
1990,Interprocess Communication in the Ninth Edition Unix System.,"When processes wish to communicate, they must first establish communication. The stream mechanisms introduced in the Eighth Edition Unix system [1], which have now become part of AT&T's Unix System V [2], provide a flexible way for processes to conduct an already-begun conversation with devices and with each other: an existing stream connection is named by a file descriptor, and the usual read, write, and I/O control requests apply. Processing modules may be inserted dynamically into a stream connection, so network protocols, terminal processing, and device drivers separate cleanly. However, these mechanisms, by themselves, do not provide a general way to create channels between processes.
Simple extensions provide new ways of establishing communication. In our system, the traditional Unix IPC mechanism, the pipe, is a cross-connected stream.

A generalisation of file-system mounting associates a stream with a named file. When the file is opened, operations on the file are operations on the stream.

Open files may be passed from one process to another over a pipe.

These low-level mechanisms allow construction of flexible and general routines for connecting local and remote processes."
1984,Reflections on Software Research.,Can the circumstances that existed in Bell Labs that nurtured the UNIX project be produced again?
1983,The UNIX Time-Sharing System (Reprint).,"UNIX is a general-purpose, multi-user, interactive operating system for the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-11/40 and 11/45 computers. It offers a number of features seldom found even in a larger operating systems, including: (1) a hierarchical file system incorporating demountable volumes; (2) compatible file, device, and inter-process I/O; (3) the ability to initiate asynchronous processes; (4) system command language selectable on a per-user basis; and (5) over 100 subsystems including a dozen languages. This paper discusses the nature and implementation of the file system and of the user command interface."
1979,The Evolution of the Unix Time-Sharing System.,"Abstract
This paper presents a brief history of the early development of the Unix operating system. It concentrates on the evolution of the file system, the process-control mechanism, and the idea of pipelined commands. Some attention is paid to social conditions during the development of the system."
