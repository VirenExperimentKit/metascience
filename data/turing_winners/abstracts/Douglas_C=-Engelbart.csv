2006,The augmented Wiki.,"Wikis are based on simple, but powerful design principles that make them useful as dynamic knowledge repositories. Now that we have a better understanding of what these principles are and why and how they work, how can we improve them? Augment, the original hypertext system which was first developed in the 1960s and is still running today, offers some possibilities for how we can evolve Wikis. In this talk, we'll describe the HyperScope, a web-based application that adds some of Augment's addressing, viewing, and jumping capabilities to any type of document format. We'll then demonstrate how the HyperScope can be married to Wikis and how such a marriage could significantly boost the capabilities of Wikis as a dynamic knowledge repository."
2004,Augmenting society's collective IQs.,"Consider a community's “Collective IQ” to represent its capability for dealing with complex, urgent problems—i.e., to understand them adequately, to unearth the best candidate solutions, to assess resources and operational capabilities and select appropriate solution commitments, to be effective in organizing and executing the selected approach, to monitor the progress and be able to adjust rapidly and appropriately to unforeseen complications, etc. "
2002,Toward Virtual Community Knowledge Evolution.,"This paper puts forth a vision and an architecture for a community knowledge evolution system. We propose augmenting a multimedia document repository (digital library) with innovative knowledge evolution support, including computer-mediated communications, community process support, decision support, advanced hypermedia features, and conceptual knowledge structures. These tools, and the techniques developed around them, would enable members of a virtual community to learn from, contribute to, and collectively build upon the community's knowledge and improve many member tasks. The resulting Collaborative Knowledge Evolution Support System (CKESS) would provide an enhanced digital library infrastructure serving as an ever-evolving repository of the community's knowledge, which members would actively use in everyday tasks and regularly update."

1998,"Augment, bootstrap communities, the Web: what next?","NLS/Augment beginning in the middle 1960s introduced many hardware and software firsts echoed in today’s windowed computing and hypermedia systems such as the World Wide Web (WWW). We demonstnte key features via historic videos and a currently running implementation, discuss its philosophical underpinnings as a tool for sup porting collaborative communities of knowledge workers, and point out essentials that we feel have yet to be s&iciently realized in widely available commercial systems. "
1998,Bootstrap alliance SIG: toward open hyperdocument systems.,"We will hold a Special Interest Group (SIG) meeting concerning the Bootstrap Alliance, a group working toward the implementation and evolution of Open Hyperdocument Systems based on lessons learned and design principles developed in products beginning with our NLS/Augment system and continuing through environments like the World Wide Web. We hope to involve participation in this Alliance by members of the greater CHI community. "

1990,Knowledge-Domain Interoperability and an Open Hyperdocument System.,"This paper anticipates that the tools and methods of computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) will become harnessed with revolutionary benefit to the ongoing, everyday knowledge work within and between larger organizations. Toward that end, the following concerns about interoperability between knowledge-work domains will have to be met, and something such as the “open hyperdocument system” must become available for widespread use. la "

1973,The augmented knowledge workshop.,This paper discusses the theme of augmenting a knowledge workshop. The first part of the paper describes the concept and framework of the knowledge workshop. The second part describes aspects of a prototype knowledge workshop being developed within this framework.
1973,Design considerations for knowledge workshop terminals.,"The theme of this paper ties directly to that developed in a concurrent paper ""The Augmented Knowledge Workshop,"" and assumes that: ""intelligent terminals"" will come to be used very, very extensively by knowledge workers of all kinds; terminals will be their constant working companions; service transactions through their terminals will cover a surprisingly pervasive range of work activity, including communication with people who are widely distributed geographically; the many ""computer-aid tools"" and human services thus accessible will represent a thoroughly coordinated ""knowledge workshop""; most of these users will absorb a great deal of special training aimed at effectively harnessing their respective workshop systems---in special working methods, conventions, concepts, and procedural and operating skills."

1961,Games That Teach the Fundamentals of Computer Operation.,"Abstract:
One who wishes to give a group of laymen a feeling for the way we computer engineers can coax sophisticated information-handling behavior from an organization of simple physical elements can provide a striking on-the-spot example by training his laymen to simulate various kinds of simple elements and by organizing them into a network whose behavior is obviously more sophisticated than that of any element. Each individual watches the up-down hand position of one or two others, and adjusts his own hand position according to a response task which is equivalent to that of an AND, OR, NOT, or flip-flop element-although task assignments are made in such a way that the participants don't hear a single esoteric word, nor realize that they might be doing ``logic.'' Counters, shift registers, and adders may be organized and operated in a way which proves very entertaining to participants and on-lookers, and yet which provides them with very realistic basic concepts about how a computer might work."
1961,A Bibliographical Sketch of All-Magnetic Logic Schemes.,"Abstract:
An all-magnetic logic scheme is one with which a workable digital system could be constructed involving only magnetic elements, current-carrying conductors, and sources of clock pulses. Historical developments of both resistance schemes (dependent upon coupling-loop resistance) and nonresistance schemes (possessing at least first-order independence of coupling-loop resistance) are described, with reference to all relevant published work known to the authors. Included are: 1) schemes using electric-circuit transfer linkage with simple cores, multipath cores, and thin-film elements, and 2) schemes using continuous magnetic structures where transfer linkage is purely magnetic."
