2013,"Abstraction, Federation, and Scalability.","Abstract:
I've often mused about the properties of structures that make them scalable. Regularity is often an element, as in geodesic domes. Abstraction is another contributor. An example of this is the layered, hierarchical, and federated structure of the Internet. Sequences of bits (physical transmission) are organized into frames (link structure) that are organized into packets with header and payload structure. TCP organizes sequences of packets into “connections” that deliver abstract sequences of payload bytes (“octets”) and are organized into higher level abstractions. At each “level” of abstraction, the details become less visible, and emergent structure becomes apparent. Groups of computers (for example, routers) form Autonomous Systems (networks) that share a common property (an “internal gateway protocol” such as IS-IS and an “external gateway protocol” such as BGP4). Encapsulation hides the lowerlayer structure in the payload of a “higher”-layer structure."
2013,The Internet at Risk.,"Abstract:
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) held its 2012 World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT) in December, where member states attempted to update the International Telecommunication Regulations (ITRs) to reflect the reality of today's telecommunication environment, one that includes mobile telephony and the Internet as a whole. Many concepts were at stake and at odds in this meeting. The tussle at WCIT could be seen as a battle between states seeing a relatively unfettered Internet as important to economic growth and democratic principles and states believing that much more national and international control over the Internet's uses should be agreed on. The Web extra is a salute to the reviewers who handled articles in 2012."
2013,Loose Couplings.,"Abstract:
Rigid designs are often brittle under stress; loosely coupled systems, on the other hand, can withstand changing conditions and stresses more effectively. Such designs are often more adaptable. Currency exchange rates, information hiding, and the design of earthquake-resistant buildings all share this loose coupling property."
2013,Running AMOOC.,"Abstract:
The idea of massive online open courses (MOOCs) have become a new touchstone in educational evolution. Many institutions are forming around this idea, and others are likely to follow. The concept raises many questions as regards economics, the effects on continuing education, testing, changes to teaching methods, and student performance.This article attempts to address some of those questions."
2013,Cargo Cults and Information Technology Development.,"Abstract:

2013,Internet and the Other IP.,"Abstract:
Copyrights have dominated the legal treatment of works of authors to the detriment of the theory of public domain treatment after a limited period of time. The imbalance should be addressed, as should the handling of rights in a digital regime where copying and distribution is trivially achieved. Recoding of rights and rights transfers for all works could be part of the solution to managing rights in a digital environment."
2013,Gateways for the Internet of Things: An old problem revisited.,"Abstract:
An early paper in network interconnection outlined the choices between adoption and adaption of protocol structures at different levels of the early Internet. This paper revisits that theme in the light of the many advances of the last three decades, and the emergence of the Internet of Things. We maintain that there are close parallels between the variety of incompatible networks which were in vogue in the early days of the Internet and the current situation with domain-specific sensor and actuator systems in the Internet of Things. We point out that there is now much more agreement on the approach to basic services, and a more universal approach to adaption. While universal adoption of common technologies is still far distant, there has been a broad consensus on the use of the Internet and web services for the access to such systems. Because of the standardization in some of the levels of web services, particularly in the context of IPv6, a consistent architecture is defined and examples of possible implementations given."

Programmers must understand the mechanisms of malware attacks if they're to defend against them. Some believe programmers should also be taught and even practice both attacks and defense under controlled conditions. The notion of practicing attacks and writing malware is controversial. Further development of forensic tools and learning to use them will complement a curriculum designed to prepare programmers for a hostile environment, especially in public networks such as the Internet."
2012,"Emergent Properties, Human Rights, and the Internet.","Abstract:
The Internet is an artifact, but its uses represent emergent properties of large numbers of users discovering ways in which to interact and share information that couldn't necessarily have been predicted from the basic Internet design. The net has become a vital part of our society, but whether access to it should be a ""human right"" is controversial. There can be no question, however, that it has become a critical tool for research, business, education, government, and social interaction."

Although rooted in the technology of his time, Vannevar Bush's portrait of the information revolution has emerged and fl ourished especially in the form of the World Wide Web resting atop the global Internet.
The panelists will explore some specifi cs of the digital information revolution, notably theory and practice in securing, authenticating and maintaining the integrity of information (Cerf); and roots of modern cryptography and current topics in this area (rivest and Shamir). They will also gain insight into the long-term problem of identifying, fi nding, and assuring the integrity of digital objects in the most general sense of that term (Kahn). Finally, they look at how our understanding of computer science is changing (Hopcroft) and how that evolution will affect the digital world in which are we spending an increasing fraction of our daily lives."

2010,Internet Predictions.,"Abstract:
Participatory sensing is the process whereby individuals and communities use ever more capable mobile phones and cloud services to collect and analyze systematic data for use in discovery. The convergence of technology and analytical innovation with a citizenry that is increasingly comfortable using mobile phones and online social networking sets the stage for this technology to dramatically impact many aspects of daily lives. Ubiquitous data capture, leveraged data processing, and personal data vault are the essential components for these emerging systems. The architecture, usage models,and application of participatory sensing were discussed in this paper."
2010,Trust and the Internet.,"Abstract:
The Internet is ready for a makeover, a need that becomes more urgent with each passing day. Although the Internet is a global infrastructure and a platform for business, discussions about the future Internet remain largely regional.

This article analyzes these different approaches and their potential consequences."

The IPv4 system doesn't disappear in 2012 nor does the Internet suddenly stop working. Rather, it can't easily expand without the implementation of IPv6 in the networks and edge devices comprising the Internet.One can imagine the use of proxy devices that could act as application-layer gateways to help such devices reach IPv6-only servers, but there are various drawbacks to this kind of design (including some difficulty with end-to-end cryptography for confidentiality)."

Associating information of all kinds with geographic location allows for the correlation and synthesis of information that would otherwise be incommensurate. The value shows up in scientific circles, social networking applications, commercial settings, command and control systems and a wide range of other uses. The incorporation of a large number of devices on the Internet contributes to this trend. These values will also be realized in space exploration applications and this talk will finish with a brief summary of the state of the art of space networking."
2007,An Information Avalanche.,"Abstract:
The Internet has added yet another dimension to the production and consumption of information. Long merely consumers of content, Internauts are now also major producers of it. Search engines make it possible to sift through the enormous quantity of material that is finding its way into digital form. Going online has become an adventure in discovery for those who eagerly surf the billions of Web pages housed in the global Internet. Because of its global reach, the Internet seriously threatens to undermine IP protection regimes that have long served copyright holders"

2005,A protocol for packet network intercommunication.,"A protocol that supports the sharing of resources that exist in different packet switching networks is presented. The protocol provides for variation in individual network packet sizes, transmission failures, sequencing, flow control, end-to-end error checking, and the creation and destruction of logical process-to-process connections. Some implementation issues are considered, and problems such as internetwork routing, accounting, and timeouts are exposed."
2004,On the evolution of Internet technologies.,"Abstract:
The Internet has been evolving from its origins in the early 1970s, based on work sponsored by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. While the basic design was known in 1973 and first published in 1974 and the system essentially deployed in the academic and military communities on January 1, 1983, much has happened in the intervening 20 years. The first commercial Internet services emerged in 1989 after the interconnection of the Internet to commercial e-mail services. By 1993, commercial versions of the World Wide Web had appeared, and by 2003, voice over IP service was growing rapidly, after its first commercial introduction around 1995 (See Vocaltec: http://www.vocaltec.com/html/about/company.shtml). The Internet of the future will be shaped by the tectonic forces of regulation, commercialization, technological change, and a wide range of policy concerns expressed at local, national, regional and international levels. In this paper, the effect of these forces is considered and an attempt made to project their effects into the future."
2004,Taking internet's temperature: prescriptions for the 21st century.,"This talk will discuss the current state of the Internet, near term projections, the importance of security and privacy on the Internet especially for health care applications, the impact of RFID, and the effect of Internet--enabling everything (""at home, in your car, in the operating room, in the office, and all the stuff you hang on your body"")."
2003,Delay-tolerant networking: an approach to interplanetary Internet.,"Abstract:
Increasingly, network applications must communicate with counterparts across disparate networking environments characterized by significantly different sets of physical and operational constraints; wide variations in transmission latency are particularly troublesome. The proposed Interplanetary Internet, which must encompass both terrestrial and interplanetary links, is an extreme case. An architecture based on a ""least common denominator"" protocol that can operate successfully and (where required) reliably in multiple disparate environments would simplify the development and deployment of such applications. The Internet protocols are ill suited for this purpose. We identify three fundamental principles that would underlie a delay-tolerant networking (DTN) architecture and describe the main structural elements of that architecture, centered on a new end-to-end overlay network protocol called Bundling. We also examine Internet infrastructure adaptations that might yield comparable performance but conclude that the simplicity of the DTN architecture promises easier deployment and extension."
2003,Requirements for the Internet.,"Abstract:
The requirements for the Internet emerged in part from the practical experiences drawn from the development, deployment and use of the ARPANET. Each distinct network would have to stand on its own and no internal changes could be required to any such network to connect it to the Internet. Communications would be on a best effort basis. If a packet didn't make it to the final destination, it would shortly be retransmitted from the source. Black boxes would be used to connect the networks; these would later be called gateways and routers. There would be no information retained by the gateways about the individual flows of packets passing through them, thereby keeping them simple and avoiding complicated adaptation and recovery from various failure modes. There would be no global control at the operations level."

This paper outlines the nature of the military requirements for packet-switched data communications and contrasts these requirements with those of commercial, industrial and private users served by common carrier public packet-switched data networks. Current US Department of Defense policy on the use of commercial standards in defense systems is reviewed. Deficiencies in existing standards for military applications are identified and implications for the development of a suitable military data communications architecture are drawn. A strategy of military standardization is outlined which adopts commercial standards where they apply and supplements these with special military standards as needed to satisfy unique military requirements. The thesis of this paper is illustrated by a discussion of the applicability of the CCITT X.25 protocol standard to military communications."

Major factors which influenced the development of this architectural model include experimental and operational experience with a large number of interconnected packet networks, assessments and evaluations of military requirements for national and international interoperability and multiple jurisdiction operation, and specific concerns regarding security, survivability and operation under crisis conditions."
1982,Packet Satellite Technology Reference Sources.,"Abstract
This paper describes briefly the packet satellite technology developed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and several other participating organizations in the U.K. and Norway and provides a biblography of relevant papers for researchers interested in experimental and operational experience with this dynamic satellite-sharing technique."
1975,Formalisms for interprocess communication.,"The literature is rich in examples of a variety of interprocess communication methods, some of which can be considered simple line control procedures (half duplex, full duplex, polled, etc.) and others which are more elaborate and deal with reordering, duplicate detection, stochastic delays, and so on. Among the most poorly worked out areas of interprocess communication is a formal representation which permits proofs to be made of correct behavior under all circumstances. Some necessary conditions for correct behavior have been proposed in the papers in this Proceedings."
1975,International dialogue.,"Any Conference the size of NCC attracts specialists from all over the world. Indeed scattered in the various technical sessions are contributions from people in Japan, Canada, England, Germany, France, and Brazil. In addition to this individual participation, there is a set of four sessions focusing on topics that were found to be of special interest to non U.S. participants. They are standardization, especially the computer connection to communication networks, but also for input/output and software. We have arranged four sessions, with significant non-U.S. participation to articulate these areas."

1970,HOST-HOST communication protocol in the ARPA network.,"The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) Computer Network (hereafter referred to as the ""ARPA network"") is one of the most ambitious computer networks attempted to date. The types of machines and operating systems involved in the network vary widely. For example, the computers at the first four sites are an XDS 940 (Stanford Research Institute), an IBM 360/75 (University of California, Santa Barbara), an XDS SIGMA-7 (University of California, Los Angeles), and a DEC PDP-10 (University of Utah). The only commonality among the network membership is the use of highly interactive time-sharing systems; but, of course, these are all different in external appearance and implementation. Furthermore, no one node is in control of the network. This has insured generality and reliability but complicates the software."
